    <p>Recipe: Authentic Rajasthani Dal Baati</p>

<p> Ingredients:
    
    For the Baati:
    
    2 cups whole wheat flour
    1/2 cup semolina (sooji)
    1/2 cup ghee (clarified butter)
    1/2 teaspoon carom seeds (ajwain)
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    Water (as needed)</p>

    <p>   
    For the Dal:
    
    1 cup split pigeon peas (toor dal)
    1/4 cup split black lentils (urad dal)
    1/4 cup split Bengal gram (chana dal)
    2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)
    1 teaspoon cumin seeds
    1 teaspoon mustard seeds
    1/2 teaspoon asafoetida (hing)
    2-3 dried red chilies
    1 onion, finely chopped
    2 tomatoes, finely chopped
    1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
    1 teaspoon turmeric powder
    1 teaspoon red chili powder
    1 teaspoon coriander powder
    1 teaspoon garam masala
    Salt to taste
    Fresh coriander leaves, chopped (for garnish)
    Lemon wedges (for serving)</p>
    <p>Instructions:
    
    For the Baati:
    
    In a large mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, semolina, carom seeds, and salt. Mix well.
    Add ghee to the mixture and crumble it using your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs.
    Gradually add water and knead the mixture into a firm dough. The dough should not be too soft or too hard.
    Divide the dough into equal-sized portions and shape them into round balls.
    Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
    Place the baati balls on a baking sheet and bake for about 30-35 minutes until they turn golden brown and crispy.</p>
    
    <p>For the Dal:
    
    Rinse the split pigeon peas, split black lentils, and split Bengal gram together. Soak them in water for 30 minutes.
    In a pressure cooker, add the soaked lentils and add enough water to cover them. Cook for about 4-5 whistles or until the lentils are soft and cooked.
    Heat ghee in a large pan or kadai over medium heat.
    Add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, and dried red chilies. Let them splutter.
    Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
    Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for a minute until the raw smell disappears.
    Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and mushy.
    Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and garam masala. Mix well and cook for a minute.
    Add the cooked lentils along with salt and mix everything together. Simmer for 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
    Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</p>
    <p> To Serve:
    
    Take a baati and generously pour ghee over it.
    Serve the baati with the dal, accompanied by chutney or pickle of your choice.
    Squeeze some lemon juice over the baati for added tanginess.
    Enjoy the delectable combination of the crispy baati and flavorful dal.
    Note: Traditional Rajasthani dal baati is typically served with a side of churma, a sweet dish made from crushed baatis mixed with ghee and jaggery. However, churma preparation is beyond the scope of this recipe.
